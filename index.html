            For as long as I can remember my family have always adopted animals from shelters or taken them in from
            family friends
            that found them and could find no one else to take them in.
            Taking care of animals that either couldn't find homes or surive on their own in the wild has always left me
            feeling confused.
            On the one hand I got to live and take care of some of the best companions I ever had, but under
            circumstances
            that I would rather never have to think about. However, the fact that people can find it in their hearts to
            take care of these
            animals not only warms my heart, but makes me happy knowing that they will be in a better place for a long
            time.
