        For as long as I can remember my family have always adopted animals from shelters or taken them in from family friends
        that found them and could find no one else to take them in.
        Taking care of animals that either couldn't find homes or surive on their own in the wild has always left me feeling confused.
        On the one hand I got to live and take care of some of the best companions I ever had, but under circumstances
        that I would rather never have to think about. However, the fact that people can find it in their hearts to take care of these
        animals not only warms my heart, but makes me happy knowing that they will be in a better place for a long time.
